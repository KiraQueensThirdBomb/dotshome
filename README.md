<p align="center">Im still a noob so
There's NO widgets (i did't play around with them yet)<br>
I have gave up on ricing neovim with lazyvim config<br>
Gtk themes SHOULD be working<br>
I don't bundle in spotify setup since it's so stupidly simple with spicetify<br>
So these dots are maybe 3/4 complete, and i wanted to complete them till the new year(2026) ( ꩜ᯅ꩜;)<br>
wait im not fricked?<br>
also i have no idea if this works or not, my machine is so weak it can't run a vm properly to test if this works<br></p>
